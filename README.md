# animal_brin_body
create prediction using linear regression

This code is for prediction of animal's body weight by its brain weight.
the model used is - Linear Regression.
the dataset used to train te model, contains list of brain weight measurements from the bunch of animals.
the data will be fit by using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot graph using matplotlib.
